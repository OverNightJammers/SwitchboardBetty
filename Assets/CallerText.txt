 - WELL HELLO THERE! This is Franklin D. Rosevelt, current president of the United States of America.
I was just checking in to make sure you still knew how incredible I am. I am such a cool president.
Do you remember that time that I took a bullet while giving a speach and then finished the speach 
before trying to fist fight the guy who shot me afterward? Thats pretty Swanky, right? Well right
now I'm in the middle of hunting for a yetti who knicked my fighting trousers and I plan to get
back, one way or another. Once I see him, I'll wack em right in the noggin with my bare presidential
fists, because that is just how cool of a president I am. Well I wont keep you tangled up in my
gobbledygook, so I'll let you get back to your job citizen. Bye and remember, 
Do what you can with what you have, where you are
